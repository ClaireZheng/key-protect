# Deleting keys
{: #deleting-keys}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}} to delete an encryption key and its contents, if you are an admin for your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} space or {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service instance.
{: shortdesc}

When you delete a key, you permanently shred its contents and associated data. The action cannot be reversed. [Destroying resources](/docs/services/key-protect?topic=key-protect-data-security#data-deletion) is not recommended for production environments, but might be useful for temporary environments such as testing or QA.

## Deleting keys with the GUI
{: #delete-key-gui}

If you prefer to delete your encryption keys by using a graphical interface, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} GUI.

[After you create or import your existing keys into the service](/docs/services/key-protect?topic=key-protect-create-root-keys), complete the following steps to delete a key:

1. [Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/){: new_window}.
2. Go to **Menu** &gt; **Resource List** to view a list of your resources.
3. From your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource list, select your provisioned instance of {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}.
4. On the application details page, use the **Keys** table to browse the keys in your service.
5. Click the â‹® icon to open a list of options for the key that you want to delete.
6. From the options menu, click **Delete key** and confirm the key deletion in the next screen.

After you delete a key, the key transitions to the _Destroyed_ state. Keys in this state are no longer recoverable. Metadata that is associated with the key, such as the key's deletion date, is kept in the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} database.

## Deleting keys with the API
{: #delete-key-api}

To delete a key and its contents, make a `DELETE` call to the following endpoint.

```
https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>
```

1. [Retrieve your service and authentication credentials to work with keys in the service](/docs/services/key-protect?topic=key-protect-set-up-api).

2. Retrieve the ID of the key that you would like to delete.

    You can retrieve the ID for a specified key by making a `GET /v2/keys/` request, or by viewing your keys in the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} dashboard.

3. Run the following cURL command to permanently delete the key and its contents.

    ```cURL
    curl -X DELETE \
      https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/<key_ID> \
      -H 'authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>' \
      -H 'bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>' \
      -H 'prefer: <return_preference>'
    ```
    {: codeblock}
  
    To work with keys within a Cloud Foundry org and space in your account, replace `Bluemix-Instance` with the appropriate `Bluemix-org` and `Bluemix-space` headers. [For more information, see the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} API reference doc ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/key-protect){: new_window}.
    {: tip}

    Replace the variables in the example request according to the following table.
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Variable</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><varname>region</varname></td>
        <td><strong>Required.</strong> The region abbreviation, such as <code>us-south</code> or <code>eu-gb</code>, that represents the geographic area where your {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service instance resides. For more information, see <a href="/docs/services/key-protect?topic=key-protect-regions#endpoints">Regional service endpoints</a>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><varname>key_ID</varname></td>
        <td><strong>Required.</strong> The unique identifier for the key that you would like to delete.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><varname>IAM_token</varname></td>
        <td><strong>Required.</strong> Your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} access token. Include the full contents of the <code>IAM</code> token, including the Bearer value, in the cURL request. For more information, see <a href="/docs/services/key-protect?topic=key-protect-retrieve-access-token">Retrieving an access token</a>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><varname>instance_ID</varname></td>
        <td><strong>Required.</strong> The unique identifier that is assigned to your {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service instance. For more information, see <a href="/docs/services/key-protect?topic=key-protect-retrieve-instance-ID">Retrieving an instance ID</a>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><varname>return_preference</varname></td>
        <td><p>A header that alters server behavior for <code>POST</code> and <code>DELETE</code> operations.</p><p>When you set the <em>return_preference</em> variable to <code>return=minimal</code>, the service returns a successful deletion response. When you set the variable to <code>return=representation</code>, the service returns the both the key material and the key metadata.</p></td>
      </tr>
      <caption style="caption-side:bottom;">Table 1. Describes the variables that are needed to delete keys with the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} API.</caption>
    </table>

    If the _return_preference_ variable is set to `return=representation`, the details of the `DELETE` request are returned in the response entity-body. The following JSON object shows an example returned value.
    ```
