# Activity Tracker events
{: #at-events}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the Activity Tracker service to track how users and applications interact with {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}}.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. In addition, you can be alerted about actions as they happen. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard. For more information, see the [getting started tutorial for {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-getting-started#getting-started).

<!-- If you have multiple events that might not be related, you can create different sections to group them. -->

## List of events
{: #at-actions}

The following table lists the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} actions that generate an event:

## Viewing events
{: #at-ui}

<!-- As in the previous section, there are multiple options. Choose the one that best suits your service, and delete the other ones. --> 

<!-- Option 2: Location based service: A location-based service generates events in the same location where the service instance is provisioned. For example, Certificate Manager. -->

Events that are generated by an instance of {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} are automatically forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service instance that is available in the same location. 

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} can have only one instance per location. To view events, you must access the web UI of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the same location where your service instance is available. For more information, see [Launching the web UI through the IBM Cloud UI](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-launch#launch_step2).

## Analyzing events
{: #at-events-analyze}

<!-- Provide information about the events in your service that add additional information in requestData and responseData. See the IAM Events topic for a sample topic that includes this section: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-at_events_iam.  -->

Due to the sensitivity of the information for an encryption key, when an event is generated as a result of an API call to the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service, the event that is generated does not include detailed information about the key. The event includes a correlation ID that you can use to identify the key internally in your cloud environment. The correlation ID is a field that is returned as part of the `responseBody.content` field. You can use this information to correlate the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} key with the information of the action that is reported through the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} event.
