# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}

{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}} helps you provision encrypted keys for apps across {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services. This tutorial shows you how to create and add existing cryptographic keys by using the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} dashboard, so you can manage data encryption from one central location.
{: shortdesc}

## Getting started with encryption keys
{: #get-started-keys}

From the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} dashboard, you can create new keys for cryptography, or you can import your existing keys. 

Choose from two key types:

<dl>
  <dt>Root keys</dt>
    <dd>Root keys are symmetric key-wrapping keys that you fully manage in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}. You can use a root key to protect other cryptographic keys with advanced encryption. To learn more, see <a href="/docs/services/key-protect/concepts/envelope-encryption.html">Envelope encryption</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Standard keys</dt>
    <dd>Standard keys are symmetric keys that are used for cryptography. You can use a standard key to directly encrypt and decrypt data.</dd>
</dl>

## Creating new keys
{: #create-keys}

[After you create an instance of {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/key-protect/?taxonomyNavigation=apps), you're ready to designate keys in the service. 

Complete the following steps to create your first cryptographic key. 

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} dashboard, click **Manage** &gt; **Add key**.
2. To create a new key, select the **Generate a new key** window.

    Specify the key's details:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Setting</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>
          <p>A unique, human-readable alias for easy identification of your key.</p>
          <p>To protect your privacy, ensure that the key name does not contain personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name or location.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Key type</td>
        <td>The <a href="/docs/services/key-protect/concepts/envelope-encryption.html#key-types">type of key</a> that you would like to manage in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}.</td>
      </tr>
      <caption style="caption-side:bottom;">Table 1. Description of the Generate new key settings</caption>
    </table>

3. When you are finished filling out the key's details, click **Generate key** to confirm. 

Keys that are created in the service are symmetric 256-bit keys, supported by the AES-GCM algorithm. For added security, keys are generated by FIPS 140-2 Level 2 certified hardware security modules (HSMs) that are located in secure {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data centers. 

## Adding existing keys
{: #add-keys}

You can enable the security benefits of Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) by introducing your existing keys to the service. 

Complete the following steps to add an existing key.

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} dashboard, click **Manage** &gt; **Add key**.
2. To upload an existing key, select the **Enter existing key** window.

    Specify the key's details:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Setting</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>
          <p>A unique, human-readable alias for easy identification of your key.</p>
          <p>To protect your privacy, ensure that the key name does not contain personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name or location.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Key type</td>
        <td>The <a href="/docs/services/key-protect/concepts/envelope-encryption.html#key-types">type of key</a> that you would like to manage in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Key material</td>
        <td>The key material, such as a symmetric key, that you want to store in the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service. The key that you provide must be base64 encoded.</td>
      </tr>
      <caption style="caption-side:bottom;">Table 2. Description of the Enter existing key settings</caption>
    </table>

3. When you are finished filling out the key's details, click **Add new key** to confirm. 

From the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} dashboard, you can inspect the general characteristics of your new keys. 

## What's next

Now, you can use your keys to code your apps and services. If you added a root key to the service, you might want to learn more about using the root key to protect the keys that encrypt your at-rest data. Check out [Wrapping keys](/docs/services/key-protect/wrap-keys.html) to get started.

- To find out more about managing and protecting your encryption keys with a root key, check out [Envelope encryption](/docs/services/key-protect/concepts/envelope-encryption.html).
- To find out more about integrating the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service with other cloud data solutions, [check out the Integrations doc](/docs/services/key-protect/integrations/integrate-services.html).
